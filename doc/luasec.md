# luasec: add secure connections to any Lua applications or scripts

``` lua
local ssl = require "ssl"
```

The LuaSec package is based on
[LuaSec](https://github.com/lunarmodules/luasec) and adapted for `luax`.
[OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/) is statically linked to LuaX and is
not required to be installed on the host.

The documentation of `LuaSec` is available at the [LuaSec web
site](https://github.com/lunarmodules/luasec/wiki).
