# import: import Lua scripts into tables

```lua
local import = require "import"
```

The import module can be used to manage simple configuration files,
configuration parameters being global variables defined in the configuration file.

```lua
local conf = import("myconf.lua", [env])
```
Evaluates `"myconf.lua"` in a new table and returns this table.
All files are tracked in `package.modpath`.

The execution environment inherits from `env` (or `_ENV` if `env` is not defined).

return function(fname, env)
    local mod = setmetatable({}, {__index = env or _ENV})
    assert(loadfile(fname, "t", mod))()
    return mod
end
