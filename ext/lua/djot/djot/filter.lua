--- @module djot.filter
--- Support filters that walk the AST and transform a
--- document between parsing and rendering, like pandoc Lua filters.
---
--- This filter uppercases all str elements.
---
---     return {
---       str = function(e)
---         e.text = e.text:upper()
---        end
---     }
---
--- A filter may define functions for as many different tag types
--- as it likes.  traverse will walk the AST and apply matching
--- functions to each node.
---
--- To load a filter:
---
---     local filter = require_filter(path)
---
--- or
---
---     local filter = load_filter(string)
---
--- By default filters do a bottom-up traversal; that is, the
--- filter for a node is run after its children have been processed.
--- It is possible to do a top-down travel, though, and even
--- to run separate actions on entering a node (before processing the
--- children) and on exiting (after processing the children). To do
--- this, associate the node's tag with a table containing `enter` and/or
--- `exit` functions.  The following filter will capitalize text
--- that is nested inside emphasis, but not other text:
---
---     local capitalize = 0
---     return {
---        emph = {
---          enter = function(e)
---            capitalize = capitalize + 1
---          end,
---          exit = function(e)
---            capitalize = capitalize - 1
---          end,
---        },
---        str = function(e)
---          if capitalize > 0 then
---            e.text = e.text:upper()
---           end
---        end
---     }
---
--- For a top-down traversal, you'd just use the `enter` functions.
--- If the tag is associated directly with a function, as in the
--- first example above, it is treated as an `exit` function.
---
--- It is possible to inhibit traversal into the children of a node,
--- by having the `enter` function return the value true (or any truish
--- value, say `'stop'`).  This can be used, for example, to prevent
--- the contents of a footnote from being processed:
---
---     return {
---       footnote = {
---         enter = function(e)
---           return true
---         end
---        }
---     }
---
--- A single filter may return a table with multiple tables, which will be
--- applied sequentially.
